I am a senior undergraduate at Cornell University studying Computer Science and Mathematics. I do research as a part of the [CAPRA][capra] lab
under [Dietrich Giesler][dietrich] and [Adrian Sampson][adrian]. At the moment, I am mainly interested in programming languages, compilers, and program verification/testing.
